This is one of my personal projects to test what I can do with Python programing language.

This is a DEMO that shows how we can control Turtle Graphics with inputs of WASD keys.

You need to install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ or Python extension from your IDE before using this program.

You can input: Color of the Turtle, Shape of the Turtle, Size of the Turtle, movements of the Turtle using input variables that we create.

And if we want to exit the program, we can exit it just by typing exit.

I tried to explain it as good as possible line by line in the code file itself.

Hope you enjoy testing it!
