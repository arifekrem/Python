This is one of my personal projects to test what I can do with Python programing language.

This is a DEMO that shows how random module of python works.

You need to install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ or Python extension from your IDE before using this program.

You can input a number thats in the list as a guess and computer will try to guess a random number in the list.

The game will end when either the player or the computer guesses the number correctly.

I tried to explain it as good as possible line by line in the code file itself.

Hope you enjoy testing it!
