This is one of my personal projects to test what I can do with Python programing language.

This is a DEMO that tests how turtle and math modules of python works.

You need to install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ or Python extension from your IDE before using this program.

The computer will draw the letter 'A' with any number (at least 4 because less than 4 is impossible) of mini-squares 

The show will end when computer finishes drawing the letter 'A'.

I tried to explain it as good as possible line by line in the code file itself.

Hope you enjoy testing it!
