This is one of my personal projects to test what I can do with Python programing language.

This is a DEMO that shows how Tkinter can be used to control Turtle Graphics.

You need to install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ or Python extension from your IDE before using this program.

Controlling Turtle module of Python with buttons and panels we created with the help of Tkinter module.

You can input: Color of the Turtle using Color panel that we create, Shape of the Turtle using Shape panel that we create, Size of the Turtle using Size panel that we create, and last but not least, movements of the Turtle using buttons that we create.

And if we want to close the Tkinter panel, we can close it with the close button that we create.

I tried to explain it as good as possible line by line in the code file itself.

Hope you enjoy testing it!
